	<h2 class="style-h1 align-center heading-underline">Disarming our&nbsp;world</h2>

	<p class="lede">Disarmament calls for ending the use of all kinds of arms – from firearms to landmines, and from nuclear bombs to chemical and biological weapons. It’s about a safer world. Having fewer arms helps to prevent and mitigate conflict, and reduces terrible human costs.</p>

	<p class="lede">The <a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/">United Nations</a> has supported disarmament and arms control from its founding. In 1946, the very first resolution of the UN General Assembly established a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/disarmament%252523:~:text=The%25252520first%25252520resolution%25252520adopted%25252520by,use%25252520only%25252520for%25252520peaceful%25252520purposes." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">commission</a> to address concerns around atomic energy.</p>

	<p class="lede">Unfortunately, the world today is still awash in weapons. Global military spending, already $2.4 trillion in 2023, continues to rise, with devastating effects. Illicit arms trading destabilizes regions, violates arms embargoes and feeds human rights abuses.</p>

	<p class="lede">In 2021, small arms and light weapons, such as firearms, killed&nbsp;<a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15533.doc.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">260,000 people</a>&nbsp;– one person every two minutes. In 70 countries and territories, some 110 million landmines and other explosives remain a painful, persistent legacy of conflicts. And at a moment of geopolitical tensions, the 12,500 nuclear weapons stockpiled around the world make the&nbsp;<a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15250.doc.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">risk of a nuclear attack higher</a>&nbsp;than at any moment since the Cold War.</p>

	<p class="lede"><a href="https://treaties.unoda.org/treaties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Twenty-seven disarmament treaties</a>&nbsp;cover different weapons and jurisdictions. They include the&nbsp;<a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/npt/%2525252523:~:text=The%25252525252520NPT%25252525252520is%25252525252520a%25252525252520landmark,and%25252525252520general%25252525252520and%25252525252520complete%25252525252520disarmament." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/att/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Arms Trade Treaty</a>. Since a popular movement successfully pushed for the passage of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apminebanconvention.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Anti-personnel Landmine Treaty</a>&nbsp;in the 1990s, for example, more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icbl.org//media/3389440/landmine-monitor-2023_web.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">55 million landmines&nbsp;</a>have been destroyed. Over 30 countries have become mine-free. Although much more remains to be done, such agreements have guided steps towards disarmament.</p>
