	<h2 class="style-h1 align-center heading-underline">New and emerging&nbsp;threats</h2>

	<p class="lede">The rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, the ever-increasing number of Internet users, advances in biotechnology and nanotechnology, and the rise in space exploration have been some of the world’s greatest achievements in recent decades. Technological advances have also contributed significantly to peace and security efforts. Satellite imagery now helps to monitor ceasefires and buffer zones. Communications platforms facilitate dialogues to prevent escalating hostilities.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="lede">New and emerging technologies, however, also present risks if used irresponsibly and unethically. Cyberattacks have become more prevalent, for example, and more countries are deploying artificial intelligence to develop autonomous weapons. The militarization of <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/index.html">outer space</a> is a growing&nbsp;challenge.</p>

	<p class="lede">These and other concerns are changing the landscape of peace and security. They add to existing threats, such as from <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/organized-crime/intro.html">organized crime</a> and terrorism. Growing insecurities linked to <a href="https://dppa.un.org/en/addressing-impact-of-climate-change-peace-and-security">climate change</a> and environmental degradation are compounding conflicts, affecting vulnerable communities already struggling with divisions, violence and displacement.</p>

	<p class="lede">The United Nations and its Member States continuously develop means to protect people as new threats arise. These have included negotiating international norms and standards on <a href="https://www.unodc.org/romena/en/cybercrime.html">cybersecurity</a>, and adopting measures to <a href="https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/">counter terrorism</a>. Ongoing efforts are strengthening agreement on the safe use of outer space and building resilience to climate&nbsp;change.</p>

	<p class="lede">As with more traditional threats and conflicts, responding to new and emerging ones requires collective action. The United Nations actively collaborates with governments, tech companies, industry experts, the scientific community and many others - to ultimately build a stronger collective security machinery that is fit to address the challenges of the 21st&nbsp;century.</p>
