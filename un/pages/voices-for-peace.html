	<p class="lede">Though conflict, violence, and division cast a long shadow, a powerful counter-movement is rising. Across the world, people are refusing to be defined by hate, choosing instead to become architects of peace. They are demanding a future that is brighter, fairer and more meaningful for everyone—regardless of race, identity or origin.</p>

	<p class="lede">These are the stories of those who dare to shape the world. Students, survivors, community leaders, activists, even neighbours—ordinary people with extraordinary courage. They are the changemakers, the peacebuilders, the ones who refuse to let violence have the final word. Their stories will inspire you, challenge you, and remind you that even the gentlest touch can send ripples of change across the world.</p>
