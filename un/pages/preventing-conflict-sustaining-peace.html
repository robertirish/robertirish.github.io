	<h2 class="style-h1 align-center heading-underline">Preventing conflict, sustaining&nbsp;peace</h2>

	<p class="lede">Preventing conflict and sustaining peace lie at the heart of UN efforts to build a safer, more secure world. Conflicts take off for reasons such as competition for resources or sectarian divides. Climate pressures increasingly exacerbate these risks. When multiple drivers of conflict accumulate, it can take very little to trigger a crisis engulfing a country or&nbsp;region.</p>

	<p class="lede">Preventing conflicts calls for tamping down tensions and fears, reducing insecurity and giving people opportunities to live peaceful, prosperous lives. It also depends on fostering inclusive societies where everybody, including women and young people, feel they have a voice in decisions affecting their lives.</p>

	<p class="lede">Efforts to prevent conflict and sustain peace cut across the United Nations. <a href="https://dppa.un.org/en">Peacemaking</a>, <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en">peacekeeping</a> and <a href="https://www.un.org/peacebuilding/">peacebuilding</a> efforts help stem violent outbreaks and rebuild societies after a&nbsp;crisis.</p>

	<p class="lede">Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-system" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">UN organizations</a>&nbsp;promote peace by assisting in restoring the rule of law as well as services and well-functioning governance. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unodc.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a>&nbsp;combats trafficking, cybercrimes and corruption. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.undp.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">UN Development Programme</a>&nbsp;supports democracy and post-conflict reconstruction, including through electoral&nbsp;support.</p>

	<p class="lede">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unhcr.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">UN Refugee Agency</a>&nbsp;protects the rights and well-being of refugees. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">UN Office of Counter-terrorism</a>&nbsp;supports stronger state capacity to address the issue.
