	<p class="lede">The importance of using diplomacy to broker peace drove the creation of the United Nations in 1945. That year, the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter">UN Charter</a>, the organization’s foundational treaty, was adopted to “save succeeding generations from the scourge&nbsp;of&nbsp;war”.</p>

	<p class="lede">Since then, threats to peace and security have multiplied and erupted in new forms. The United Nations continues to evolve in its central role in diplomacy for peace, deploying multiple tools to negotiate, mediate and foster cooperation, including the UN Secretary-General’s <a href="https://peacemaker.un.org/peacemaking-mandate/secretary-general">Good Offices</a>, among and within countries. In everything it does, the United Nations upholds principles to protect humanity, such as the non-use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, cooperation and the sovereign equality of&nbsp;nations.</p>

	<p class="lede">Diplomacy for peace is dynamic and often complex. Progress depends on trust, solidarity and universality. To strengthen the world’s collective response, the UN Secretary-General in 2023 presented countries with <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-new-agenda-for-peace-en.pdf">A New Agenda for Peace</a>. It provides a blueprint to tackle emerging security risks, from civil conflicts that spill across borders to the weaponization of&nbsp;technology.</p>

	<p class="lede">UN tools for peace diplomacy centre on the 15-member Security Council. It investigates threats, marshals political will for peaceful solutions, establishes peace operations and can <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7">impose sanctions and other restrictions</a> on parties to a&nbsp;conflict.</p>
